NAME: plotter.js

AUTHOR: Dustin Larimer - DataFolkLabs, LLC

DESCRIPTION:

Plotter.js is a light-weight, unobtrusive plotting utility for the Google Maps 
API (v3). Bind the plugin to a Google Map and attach hooks to existing 
interactions to turn the utility on/off or return calculated area of a 
selection. This plugin has minimal jQuery dependency, but hopefully that can 
be removed soon.

NAME: plotter.js

AUTHOR: Dustin Larimer - DataFolkLabs, LLC

DESCRIPTION:

Plotter.js is a light-weight, unobtrusive plotting utility for the Google Maps API (v3).
Bind the plugin to a Google Map and attach hooks to existing interactions to turn the utility on/off or return calculated area of a selection. This plugin has minimal jQuery dependency, but hopefully that can be removed soon.
